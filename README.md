- 👋 Hi, I’m @miyrt Erika Close             
- 👀 I’m interested in anything related to Oracle database administration
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more detailed information about RAC and dataguard
  and 19c features as I took a brief time out from database adminstration in 2018
- to 2021 to tried my hand at being a Documentum administrator.  I also want to
- take the certification tests for oracle just for my own gratification.  I worked
- from 2021 to 2023 present as an oracle dba supporting oracle 11g to 19g.
- Supporting even dataguard.  I want to be an expert. So I still an studying in
- my spare time for oracle tests.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything yet, but possibly in the future will likely be.
- 📫 How to reach me ... try this site.
